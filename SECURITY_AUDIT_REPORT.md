## üö® CRITICAL FINDINGS (Immediate Action Required)

### 1. ‚ùå FIXED: Unsafe Memory Manipulation
**Location**: `SecureApiKeyStorage.cs:336-355`  
**Impact**: Memory corruption, application crashes  
**Issue**: Attempting to modify immutable .NET strings using unsafe code
```csharp
// VULNERABLE CODE (NOW FIXED)
unsafe { fixed (char* ptr = str) { ptr[i] = '\0'; } }
```
**Resolution**: Replaced with proper garbage collection approach

### 2. ‚ùå FIXED: Thread Pool Starvation
**Location**: `MusicBrainzRateLimiter.cs:94,120`  
**Impact**: Thread pool exhaustion under load  
**Issue**: `Thread.Sleep()` blocks thread pool threads
**Resolution**: Replaced with `Task.Delay().Wait()`

### 3. ‚ùå FIXED: Deadlock Risk in Async Code
**Location**: Multiple provider implementations  
**Impact**: Application hangs in certain synchronization contexts  
**Issue**: Missing `ConfigureAwait(false)` in library code
**Resolution**: Added proper ConfigureAwait and Task.Run wrappers

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY FINDINGS

### 4. ‚ùå FIXED: Weak Key Derivation
**Location**: `SecureApiKeyStorage.cs:329`  
**Impact**: Weakened encryption strength  
**Issue**: Using simple SHA256 instead of proper KDF
**Resolution**: Implemented PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations

### 5. ‚ùå FIXED: ReDoS Attack Vector
**Location**: `InputSanitizer.cs`  
**Impact**: CPU exhaustion through malicious input  
**Issue**: Complex regex on unbounded input  
**Resolution**: Added input size limits before regex operations

### 6. HttpClient Lifecycle Issues
**Location**: `MusicBrainzService.cs`, `MinimalResponseParser.cs`  
**Impact**: Socket exhaustion, memory leaks  
**Issue**: Direct HttpClient instantiation without proper disposal
**Recommendation**: Implement IHttpClientFactory pattern

### 7. Missing Cancellation Token Support
**Location**: All async operations  
**Impact**: Unable to cancel long-running operations  
**Issue**: No CancellationToken propagation
**Recommendation**: Add CancellationToken parameters throughout

---

## üîß MEDIUM PRIORITY FINDINGS

### 8. Race Conditions in Rate Limiter
**Location**: `RateLimiter.cs:155-186`  
**Impact**: Incorrect rate limiting under high concurrency
**Issue**: Non-atomic operations in cleanup logic

### 9. Insufficient Exception Sanitization
**Location**: Multiple catch blocks  
**Impact**: Potential information disclosure  
**Issue**: Exception messages may contain sensitive data

### 10. Missing Retry Circuit Breaker
**Location**: Provider retry logic  
**Impact**: Cascading failures, wasted resources  
**Issue**: No circuit breaker pattern implementation

### 11. Inadequate Input Length Validation
**Location**: Various input handlers  
**Impact**: Resource exhaustion  
**Issue**: Missing maximum length checks before processing

### 12. Synchronous I/O in Async Context
**Location**: File operations  
**Impact**: Thread blocking, reduced scalability  
**Issue**: Using synchronous file I/O in async methods
