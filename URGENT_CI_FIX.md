# ðŸš¨ URGENT: CI is Broken - Manual Fix Required

## The Problem
The CI builds are failing because:
1. The workflow doesn't build Lidarr from source first
2. Node.js version is too old (needs 20+, but using 18)

## The Solution (5 minutes)

### Option 1: Quick Copy (Recommended)
```bash
# Copy the complete fixed workflow with Node.js 20
cp workflow-templates/ci-fixed-node20.yml .github/workflows/ci.yml

# Commit and push
git add .github/workflows/ci.yml
git commit -m "fix: add Lidarr build steps with Node.js 20 to CI workflow"
git push origin terragon/review-build-fix-tech-debt
```

### Option 2: GitHub Web Interface
1. Go to: https://github.com/RicherTunes/Brainarr/edit/terragon/review-build-fix-tech-debt/.github/workflows/ci.yml
2. Copy contents from `workflow-templates/ci-updated.yml`
3. Paste into the editor
4. Commit directly to the branch

## What the Fix Does
- âœ… Adds Node.js setup for Yarn
- âœ… Builds Lidarr from source before building plugin
- âœ… Sets LIDARR_PATH environment variable
- âœ… Adds build caching for faster CI
- âœ… Updates all 3 CI jobs (test, build-plugin, security-scan)

## Verification
After applying the fix, the CI should:
1. âœ… Build Lidarr successfully from submodule
2. âœ… Build the plugin with proper Lidarr references
3. âœ… Pass all tests
4. âœ… Complete security scan

The failing errors like `CS0234: The type or namespace name 'Parser' does not exist` will be resolved because Lidarr assemblies will be available.

**This fix is ready to apply immediately. All the tech debt has been resolved except this final workflow update.**
