Context: Repo: I:\Arr-Plugins\Lidarr\Brainarr
Branch: main (working tree has pending CL changes)
Build/test hints:
- .NET solution with projects Brainarr.Plugin and Brainarr.Tests.
- Tests present for providers, core pipeline, resilience, security, configuration.
- Logging: NLog; HTTP: NzbDrone.Common.Http; CI workflow .github/workflows/test-and-coverage.yml (untracked) suggests coverage pipeline.
Key entry points to inspect beyond the two included files:
- Services/Core/* (Orchestrator, Coordinator, Manager/Invoker, ModelActionHandler)
- Services/Providers/* (provider implementations + Capabilities/Shared)
- Configuration/* (settings & enums + ModelIdMapper)
- Resilience/* (CircuitBreaker)
- Tests/* (updated suites; especially ModelActionHandlerTests)
Ask clarifying questions only if essential; otherwise produce the plan and feedback directly.


Agent: You are the chief architect. Review the pending change-list (uncommitted working tree changes) for the Brainarr plugin and produce a comprehensive, scalable, regression‑averse plan and concrete review feedback. Focus on performance, safety, and maintainability. Output clear, prioritized action items with rationale, proposed code‑level changes, and a verification matrix (tests, metrics, and rollout). Context below gives you a head start; feel free to read additional files as needed.

Project overview
- Domain: Lidarr/NzbDrone plugin “Brainarr” for AI‑assisted music recommendations.
- Language: C#/.NET (NzbDrone Core), logging via NLog, HTTP via NzbDrone.Common.Http.
- Key responsibilities:
  - Select and invoke multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Gemini, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Perplexity, LMStudio, Ollama).
  - Orchestrate recommendation pipeline: validate, enrich (MBIDs), deduplicate, apply safety gates, top‑up to target.
  - Enforce resilience (circuit breaker), rate limits, and safe logging.

What changed (pending CL snapshot)
Run at 2025‑09‑10: git diff --stat shows 28 files changed, 642 insertions, 464 deletions, touching core pipeline and many providers:
- Core: RecommendationPipeline.cs (+67/‑), ProviderRegistry.cs (+59/‑), TopUpPlanner.cs (+16), RecommendationCoordinator.cs (+1)
- Config: BrainarrSettings.cs (+23/‑), Enums.cs (+2), ModelIdMapper.cs (+37/‑), StopSensitivityJsonConverter.cs (+2/‑)
- Providers: LMStudioProvider (+135/‑), OpenAIProvider (+61/‑), PerplexityProvider (+75/‑), GroqProvider (+60/‑), OpenRouterProvider (+60/‑), DeepSeekProvider (+58/‑)
- Tests updated across providers and core (ModelActionHandlerTests large refactor).

High‑level architecture (selected dirs)
- Brainarr.Plugin/
  - Configuration/ (defaults, provider enums, model ID mapping)
  - Services/
    - Core/ (Orchestrator, Pipeline, Coordinator, Registry, TopUpPlanner, Sanitizer)
    - Providers/ (Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Perplexity, Groq, Gemini, DeepSeek, LMStudio, Ollama + Parsing, Capabilities, StructuredOutputs)
    - Resilience/ (CircuitBreaker)
    - Security/, Validation/, Telemetry/, Support/, Cost/, Enrichment/, Http/
  - Performance/, TechDebt/, Utils/
- Brainarr.Tests/
  - Services/Core, Services/Providers, Resilience, Security, Configuration, EdgeCases, Telemetry, Validation, Support, Helpers

Two key files included for quick orientation (full repo available to read):
- Brainarr.Plugin/Services/Core/RecommendationPipeline.cs (pipeline, top‑up, dedup, logging)
- Brainarr.Plugin/Services/Core/ProviderRegistry.cs (model mapping, provider construction, capabilities)

Goals for your plan
1) Scalability: Handle high concurrency (multiple users/runs), backpressure, rate limiting per provider, cancellation propagation, and memory efficiency. Identify O(n) hotspots, batching opportunities, streaming/structured outputs tradeoffs, and thread safety.
2) Regression risk: Enumerate risky edits in the CL (provider mappings, thinking modes, structured outputs toggles, validator changes). Propose targeted tests and guardrails.
3) Reliability & Security: Timeouts/retries/jitter, circuit breaker per provider/model, safe logging (no PII/secrets), model‑ID mapping correctness, schema validation for structured outputs.
4) Observability: Minimal‑overhead metrics (latency p50/p95/p99 per provider/model, error rates, circuit open %, top‑up hit rate), correlation IDs, and log sampling.
5) Developer experience: Simpler extension of providers; remove duplicated mapping logic; isolate capability detection; clear defaults.

Constraints and preferences
- Keep public surface area stable unless clearly justified; prefer additive changes.
- Leverage existing abstractions (IProviderRegistry, IRecommendationPipeline, IAIProvider) and resilience components.
- Avoid global locks; prefer async/concurrent, cancellation‑aware code.
- Prefer low‑risk, high‑ROI refactors over wide changes.

Deliverables
- A concrete, step‑by‑step review and improvement plan with:
  - Prioritized checklist (Now, Next, Later) with owners and estimated complexity.
  - Code‑level recommendations (method/class names, signatures) for key hotspots.
  - Test plan (unit, property, integration, chaos/resilience), including table of scenarios per provider/model.
  - Metrics/alerts to add with thresholds and rollout strategy (canary, feature flags, % rollout).
  - Risk assessment: where regressions are likely and how to prevent/mitigate.

Definition of done
- Plan is complete, actionable, scoped; includes verification/rollback steps.
- Touches all modified areas listed above and calls out gaps to investigate.
- Explicitly addresses scaling behavior and regression prevention.


Desired output: Architect-grade plan and review feedback covering scalability, regressions, reliability, observability, and developer experience with prioritized steps, code-level recommendations, test plan, and rollout strategy.

**Exploring Git commands**

I’m going to check the modifications in my Git repository. My plan is to start with `git status` and `git diff --stat`, then look at specific changes using `git diff -- path`. I can’t use `sed` or the `type` command, but I can use `git show :path` to view the worktree. To see uncommitted changes, I can also run `git diff path`. If needed, I'll check for full file content with `git cat-file -p :path`.
**Using ripgrep for content**

I can use `rg -n "" path` to search, but that only returns lines. To print the file content, I can use `rg -n -H -n . path`, which matches all lines but could result in a lot of output. It maxes out at 256 lines, so I could limit this to 250 lines using `head`, though `head` might not be available. Instead, I can use `rg -n --max-count`, or `-m NUM` to stop after a certain number of matches. I'll aim for the first 250 lines of the file.

**Running git diff**

I have a list of modified files, which is great! Now, I want to run a command like `git diff --stat` to check the insertions and deletions in those files. It’s important to confirm what changes have been made, and this command helps provide a summary view. I should ensure that the output captures the relevant statistics clearly, so I can understand the extent of the modifications. Let's check that!

**Evaluating Git Commands**

The 'rg' command isn’t available, so I’m wondering if I can use the 'type' command instead. However, I’m not sure if that's allowed since the harness seems limited to a specific 'command' array. Maybe I can also consider using 'git show :path' for staged changes, but we really want the working version. Using 'git diff -U250 path' might show the full file with context, but I'll aim to focus on the right command to see changes. I'll proceed with 'git diff -- Brainarr.Plugin/Services/Core/RecommendationPipeline.cs'.

**Reviewing code modifications**

I noticed some updates in the provider registry, like the addition of preferStructured flags from Capabilities. There’s also a change in the LMStudioProvider signature to now include temperature and maxTokens, which seems helpful. Additionally, the Perplexity model mapping now delegates to ModelIdMapper. That's a positive step! I think it would be beneficial to check the diff for ModelIdMapper.cs to see what changes were made there.

I'm making sure that ModelIdMapper normalizes Perplexity to the specific version of llama-3.1 sonar online 128k slugs. I also changed the mapping to 'v' and realized that it now returns the raw unchanged value instead of the label variable. It's interesting how these adjustments can impact the output. I want to keep track of these changes to ensure everything works as expected.

**Evaluating structured responses**

I'm looking into introducing Shared.ChatRequestFactory.BuildBodies to create a structured JSON response format, with a fallback option. It's nice that there's also transient warmup detection and retries, as well as parameters for temperature and max tokens override. I should check how the OpenAIProvider and PerplexityProvider are handling the 'preferStructured' parameter and how the toggles affect structured outputs. This could be a useful enhancement!

**Reviewing code changes**

I've mainly focused on adding logging, without any major changes to algorithms aside from structuring outputs and iteration profile contexts. There's a folder for Provider Capabilities that isn't tracked. I feel like I should check what 'PreferStructuredByDefault' does. Even though it's untracked and not in git, I can read it from the filesystem. I can try using 'git ls-files' to list untracked files instead. That's an option I can explore.

**Planning system resilience**

I need to explore the resilience aspect, perhaps focusing on a CircuitBreaker. It’s clear we’re in a read-only state, so we can’t run tests, but we should still create a high-level plan addressing scalability and regression risks.

I’ll suggest some code-level changes for things like cancellation tokens, concurrency control, and rate limiting. Also, we should validate the structured output schema and implement metrics for latencies and error rates to maintain minimal overhead. How should I structure this implementation?
**Standardizing logging and resilience**

I need to propose generating correlation IDs for logs and outgoing requests, leveraging 'InfoWithCorrelation' in the provider code. It's essential to standardize correlation across the pipeline with a CorrelationIdContext. For reliability, I'll suggest implementing timeouts, retries with jitter, and circuit breakers for each provider/model in the ResiliencePolicy. We should unify resilience practices and centralize model ID mapping to avoid duplication. Plus, I want to consider structured output preferences per provider, with TTL for various toggles. Scalability will be crucial, so managing concurrent provider calls and memory effectively is a must!
**Optimizing batching and safety**

I’m considering batching and whether to combine efforts into a larger batch size while using a HashSet for deduplication based on artist and album. It’s crucial to ensure normalization and culture invariance for efficiency.

For thread safety in the FormatPreferenceCache, I’ll need to confirm if it’s properly implemented, possibly using ConcurrentDictionary to avoid issues. Logging should be secure, with no sensitive information included, and we should conduct an audit on prompts. Rate limiting needs implementation via IRateLimiter, and I should create a verification matrix for tests across providers, covering various scenarios.
**Structuring metrics and rollout strategy**

I’m proposing a canary release for the "prefer structured JSON" feature with a default setting that's easy to adjust. It’ll include a risk assessment focusing on provider mappings since changing model slugs could disrupt functionality if not supported in certain regions.

I also want to unify the ChatRequestFactory across providers, ensuring features like cancellation tokens and concurrent requests through a RequestCoordinator. Crafting a final response will involve structured sections, covering priorities, code-level recommendations, risks, and mitigation strategies. I’ll reference specific methods like ProviderRegistry.Register to influence how we handle structured JSON preferences.
**Drafting structured recommendations**

I need to create 10-20 concise bullet points for the structured output. The focus is on the pending CL changes, such as enhanced logging in the pipeline, adjustments to `GetIterationProfile()`, and improvements in LMStudio.

I’ll comment on regression risks from altered default model IDs and potential performance issues from string operations. It’s essential to integrate cancellation tokens properly and check for concurrent top-ups in the orchestrator. For thread safety, I’ll suggest ensuring the FormatPreferenceCache handles concurrency.

Including a verification matrix with grouped scenarios per provider and proposing canary rollout strategies will also be key in the final plan.

Here’s a focused, architect-grade plan and review based on the pending change-list. I reviewed diffs for RecommendationPipeline.cs, ProviderRegistry.cs, ModelIdMapper.cs, LMStudioProvider.cs, OpenAI/Perplexity/Groq/OpenRouter/DeepSeek providers, BrainarrSettings, Enums, and StopSensitivityJsonConverter. The CL meaningfully improves model-ID normalization, structured output fallbacks, iteration/profile semantics, and LM Studio resilience. Below I prioritize stability, scale, and regression protection.

**Now (Stabilize + Guardrails)**

- Core Concurrency: add bounded, cancellation-aware concurrency controls
  - Owner: Core (M)
  - Rationale: Multiple users/runs can saturate provider APIs. Add per-provider SemaphoreSlim and per-process max outstanding calls.
  - Change: Introduce `IRequestGate` with `AcquireAsync(provider, model, ct)` using `ConcurrentDictionary<(AIProvider,string), SemaphoreSlim>`. Wire into all provider invocations from Orchestrator/Coordinator/TopUpPlanner.
- Structured Output Fallbacks: make preference thread-safe, time-bounded, and settings-aware
  - Owner: Providers (S)
  - Rationale: New `FormatPreferenceCache` should be thread-safe and avoid permanent stickiness from transient failures.
  - Change: Ensure it uses `ConcurrentDictionary<string,(bool preferStructured, DateTimeOffset expires)>` with TTL (e.g., 6h). In ProviderRegistry, derive final preference as `settings.PreferStructuredJsonForChat && ProviderCapabilities.Get(provider).PreferStructuredByDefault`.
- Model-ID Mapping: centralize across ALL code paths
  - Owner: Config (S)
  - Rationale: CL fixed Perplexity via ModelIdMapper but several mappings remain in ProviderRegistry. Remove duplication to avoid drift.
  - Change: In `ProviderRegistry`, use `ModelIdMapper.ToRawId(providerName, modelLabel)` for OpenAI/Groq/OpenRouter/DeepSeek/Gemini and delete the bespoke switch mappers except where the mapping encodes special behavior (e.g., thinking sentinel).
- LM Studio Resilience: contain retry policy and error checks
  - Owner: Providers (S)
  - Rationale: New warmup/transient handling is good; bound retries and unify jitter.
  - Change: Move transient detection + backoff to a shared helper: `TransientRetry.Handle(async () => SendAsync(body), maxRetries: 5, jitter: true, shouldRetry: IsLMStudioTransient)`. Ensure max cumulative delay ≤ 3s per body and respect `cancellationToken`.
- Logging Safety and Signal-to-Noise
  - Owner: Core (S)
  - Rationale: Many new Info logs; default noise could be high at scale.
  - Change: Route “header/summary” logs as Debug unless `settings.EnableDebugLogging` or a correlation is active. Use `_logger.InfoWithCorrelation` for high-level summaries when correlation present. Ensure provider request/response snippets only log under Debug/Flag and redact secrets.
- Cancellation Propagation End-to-End
  - Owner: Core (S)
  - Rationale: Pipeline checks cancellation but might not pass CTs through all layers.
  - Change: Thread `CancellationToken` down to providers and top-up (`TopUpPlanner.TopUpAsync(..., ct)`), and through resilience wrappers. Ensure all `Task.Delay` calls use `ct`.
- Circuit Breaker Per Provider/Model
  - Owner: Resilience (M)
  - Rationale: With structured fallback and model variants, circuit needs to be keyed by `(provider, rawModel)`.
  - Change: Update resilience policy/circuit keys accordingly. Export state for observability (see Metrics).

**Next (Scale + Maintainability)**

- Rate Limiting and Backpressure
  - Owner: Resilience (M)
  - Rationale: Prevent burst overload from top-ups/parallel runs.
  - Change: Add `IRateLimiter` per (provider, model) using token bucket (burst N, refill R/s); ensure backoff integrates with retry policy; reuse existing `RateLimiterTests`.
- Unify Request Construction
  - Owner: Providers (M)
  - Rationale: CL introduces `Shared.ChatRequestFactory`. Finish migrating all providers (OpenAI, OpenRouter, Groq, DeepSeek, Perplexity, LMStudio) to that factory for message, temperature, max_tokens, and response_format (schema/text/bare) sequencing.
  - Change: Expose `BuildBodies(AIProvider provider, string model, string system, string user, double temp, int maxTokens, bool preferStructured)` and remove duplicate per-provider object builders.
- Recommendation Schema Validation
  - Owner: Core (S)
  - Rationale: Clamp malformed outputs early.
  - Change: Add a `IRecommendationSchemaValidator.Validate(List<Recommendation>)` pre-dedup to drop invalids; mirror with tests in newly added `RecommendationSchemaValidatorTests`.
- Dedup/Normalization Performance
  - Owner: Core (S)
  - Rationale: Ensure O(n) dedup on large lists.
  - Change: Verify `_duplicationPrevention` and `_libraryAnalyzer` use `HashSet` with normalization keys `(artist|album).ToUpperInvariant().Trim()`; ensure culture-invariant compare. Add micro-bench test or perf assert.
- Provider Capability Isolation
  - Owner: Providers (S)
  - Rationale: New `Capabilities` dir (untracked) – stabilize public contract.
  - Change: Define `ProviderCapability { PreferStructuredByDefault, SupportsThinking, SupportsJSONSchema, MaxTokensCap }`. Consume only through this API in registry and providers.
- Defaults and UX
  - Owner: Config (S)
  - Rationale: Perplexity default changed to `llama-3.1-sonar-*-online`. Safer with fallback.
  - Change: If chosen ID fails with 4xx, fallback to the closest sibling (small/large) once before giving up; log Info summary.

**Later (Perf, Observability, DX polish)**

- Batching and Streaming
  - Owner: Core/Providers (M/L)
  - Rationale: Memory efficiency and latency.
  - Change: If providers support streaming, parse incrementally and early-stop at target count; otherwise, allow batch-size hints to providers to avoid overshoot.
- Provider Pools and DNS/Socket Reuse
  - Owner: HTTP (M)
  - Rationale: Reduce connection churn.
  - Change: Ensure `IHttpClient` already reuses sockets; set explicit per-host connection limits; enable HTTP/2 where supported for chat endpoints.
- Pluggable Policies
  - Owner: Resilience (M)
  - Rationale: Chaos/resilience tuning without code changes.
  - Change: Externalize retry counts, jitter, and breaker thresholds to advanced settings; keep safe defaults.

**Code-Level Recommendations**

- ProviderRegistry
  - Change: Replace per-provider mapping switches with `ModelIdMapper.ToRawId(provider, modelEnumOrSlug)` except for special “thinking” decorations.
  - Change: Compute structured-preference as:
    - `var preferStructured = settings.PreferStructuredJsonForChat && ProviderCapabilities.Get(provider).PreferStructuredByDefault;`
  - Signature impact: None externally; internal refactor.
- Providers (OpenAI, Perplexity, OpenRouter, Groq, DeepSeek, LMStudio)
  - Change: Migrate to `Shared.ChatRequestFactory` and `Shared.FormatPreferenceCache` everywhere.
  - Change: Cache key standardization: `var cacheKey = $"{provider}:{rawModel}";`
  - Change: After response, set preference based on attempt index and success. Add TTL.
  - Change: Always pass `cancellationToken` to HTTP and `Task.Delay`.
- LMStudioProvider
  - Keep: Temperature/maxTokens overrides.
  - Change: Move warmup detection into `IsLMStudioTransient(HttpResponse)` helper and unify backoff with jitter in shared policy.
- RecommendationPipeline
  - Change: Use `settings.GetIterationProfile()` consistently; ensure the profile carries:
    - `EnableRefinement`, `MaxIterations`, `ZeroStop`, `LowStop`, `GuaranteeExactTarget`.
  - Change: Switch final status log to Debug unless debug mode or correlation present.
  - Change: Ensure CT propagated into `_topUpPlanner.TopUpAsync(settings, ..., ct)`.
- ResiliencePolicy
  - Change: Add `WithHttpResilienceAsync` overload that accepts `breakerKey` and `shouldRetry(HttpResponse)`, `maxJitterMs`.
  - Circuit key: `($"{provider}:{rawModel}")`.
- ModelIdMapper
  - Keep: Perplexity normalization. Add unit coverage for synonyms:
    - `sonar-large|small|huge`, `llama-3.1-sonar-*-online`, legacy underscores/hyphens.
  - Change: Ensure idempotent: calling ToRawId twice returns same output.

**Regression Risks & Targeted Guardrails**

- Perplexity default change to llama-3.1 sonar online
  - Risk: Accounts lacking online model entitlement; 4xx on otherwise valid configs.
  - Guardrail: Fallback to small/large sibling or prior slug once; test with mocked 400/422.
- Structured Output toggle + caching
  - Risk: Sticky disable after one transient schema rejection; race conditions in cache.
  - Guardrail: TTL cache with thread-safe updates; per-process default still read from settings on cold start. Tests: concurrent requests flip preference correctly.
- Thinking mode sentinel in OpenRouter/Anthropic
  - Risk: Appending “:thinking” / “#thinking” incorrectly to non-supporting models.
  - Guardrail: `ProviderCapabilities.SupportsThinking` gate; unit tests per model.
- Logging volume at Info
  - Risk: Flooding logs in large runs.
  - Guardrail: Use Debug level by default; Info only with correlation or when `EnableDebugLogging`.
- Top-up semantics switch (`EnableIterativeRefinement` → `GetIterationProfile().EnableRefinement`)
  - Risk: Behavior drift if profiles miscomputed.
  - Guardrail: Unit tests verifying parity with default legacy settings; tests for Strict/Normal/Lenient profiles.

**Test Plan (Unit/Property/Integration/Chaos)**

- Core Pipeline
  - Valid/duplicate/top-up thresholds across profiles: Off/Lenient/Normal/Strict/Aggressive (artists vs albums).
  - Cancellation propagation: cancel mid-dedup and mid-top-up.
  - Property test: dedup idempotency and O(n) behavior with 10k items.
- Model Mapping
  - Perplexity synonyms: sonar-large/small/huge, llama-3.1-sonar-*-online, legacy with underscores/hyphens; idempotency tests.
  - All providers: `ModelIdMapper.ToRawId` returns expected slugs for enums.
- Providers (per provider/model)
  - Structured preference: schema success → cache=on; schema 400/422 → fallback to text/bare + cache=off; TTL expiry flips back to default.
  - Retry scopes: OpenAI 429/5xx retried; 400 no retry. LMStudio transient warmup retried with jitter caps.
  - Parsing fallbacks: inner message content empty → raw body parse succeeds.
  - Security: No API key in logs; response snippet logging only under Debug flag.
- Resilience/CircuitBreaker
  - Key per provider/model; opens on sustained 5xx; resets with half-open trial; ensures no global lock.
- Performance micro-bench
  - Dedup time grows ~linearly; memory within bounds on 10k recs.
- Chaos
  - Randomly inject 429/500/timeouts with jitter; assert breaker opens and pipeline degrades gracefully to partial results.
- Integration (smoke)
  - End-to-end with OpenAI/Groq/Perplexity mocks: target=25; validate counts, dedup, and top-up behavior.

Scenarios by provider/model (sampling):
- OpenAI: gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o. Schema on/off; 429; 500; timeout.
- OpenRouter: anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet with and without :thinking; schema support toggled.
- Perplexity: llama-3.1-sonar-large-128k-online and small; 422 structured rejection; text fallback.
- Groq: llama-3.3-70b-versatile; schema toggle; 5xx backoff.
- DeepSeek: deepseek-chat vs reasoner; schema toggle.
- LMStudio: model loading/warmup → transient retries; `response_format` unsupported → fallback body works.

**Metrics & Alerts**

- Latency: p50/p95/p99 per (provider, model)
  - Thresholds: p99 > 20s alert (warn), > 45s critical.
- Error Rate: 5xx/timeout per (provider, model)
  - Thresholds: >5% over 10m warn, >15% critical.
- Circuit State: % open per (provider, model)
  - Thresholds: >20% open over 10m warn.
- Top-up Efficacy: top-up invoked %, deficit resolved %, average iterations
  - Track hit rate to tune profiles.
- Fallback Mode: structured→text fallback count per (provider, model)
  - Alert on sustained flips that indicate schema compatibility issues.
- Correlation IDs: propagate via `InfoWithCorrelation`; include provider/model in log context for low overhead.

Implementation: minimal overhead counters (in-memory rolling windows) with optional export to existing telemetry sink. Use sampling when logging payload snippets.

**Rollout Strategy**

- Feature flags:
  - `PreferStructuredJsonForChat` (default true): 25% → 50% → 100% over 1–2 days; monitor fallback metrics.
  - Perplexity default model change flag: canary 10% → 100%; auto-fallback to legacy slugs on first 4xx.
- Canary tests: run RecommendationPipelineTests and ProviderParsingSmokeTests in CI; block if error/latency metrics regress >10%.
- Fast rollback: env var to disable structured outputs globally; separate toggle to revert Perplexity model mapping to legacy.

**Risk Assessment**

- Highest: Perplexity model slug changes; structured outputs across gateways.
- Medium: Iteration profile behavior drift; logging volume changes.
- Lower: LMStudio transient handling (cap jitter) and temperature/maxTokens overrides (ensure bounded ranges).

**Ownership and Complexity**

- Core: Concurrency, cancellation, logs (M)
- Providers: Request factory, preference cache TTL, LMStudio transient policy (M)
- Resilience: Per-provider/model breaker, rate limiter (M)
- Config: Centralized mapping finalization (S)
- Telemetry: Metrics counters and alerts (S/M)

**Proposed Concrete Changes (high-value snippets)**

- IRequestGate
  - `Task<IDisposable> AcquireAsync(AIProvider provider, string rawModel, CancellationToken ct)`
- ProviderRegistry Create
  - `var raw = ModelIdMapper.ToRawId("openai", model); var preferStructured = settings.PreferStructuredJsonForChat && ProviderCapabilities.Get(AIProvider.OpenAI).PreferStructuredByDefault; return new OpenAIProvider(http, logger, settings.OpenAIApiKey, raw, preferStructured);`
- Provider send paths
  - Use `ChatRequestFactory.BuildBodies(...)` and `FormatPreferenceCache.Get/Set(cacheKey, prefer, ttl)`.
- Resilience wrappers
  - `WithHttpResilienceAsync(fn, origin, logger, ct, maxRetries, shouldRetry, breakerKey: $"{provider}:{model}", maxJitterMs: 200)`

If you’d like, I can draft the specific changes for ProviderRegistry to remove duplicate mapping logic and wire the structured preference to settings and capabilities, plus the thread-safe, TTL-based FormatPreferenceCache interface and tests.
