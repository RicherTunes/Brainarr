# Brainarr Verification Results – Brainarr 1.2.4

**Verification date:** 2025-09-12  
**Scope:** Functional smoke tests, documentation audit, and compatibility review for Brainarr 1.2.4 running on Lidarr 2.14.1.4716 (nightly/plugins branch).

## Executive Summary
- ✅ **Core workflows** – Import list fetch, configuration validation, and review queue orchestration operate end-to-end against Lidarr nightly builds.
- ✅ **Verified providers** – LM Studio (local, Qwen 3), Google Gemini (cloud, Flash), and Perplexity (cloud, Sonar Large) pass manual smoke tests.
- ⚠️ **Pending verification** – Ollama, DeepSeek, Groq, OpenAI, Anthropic, and OpenRouter compile and expose configuration but need fresh runtime validation.
- ✅ **Resilience features** – Rate limiting, provider health checks, iterative top-up, and safety gates exercised via unit/integration tests.

## Test Environment
| Component | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Lidarr | 2.14.1.4716 (nightly/plugins) in Docker image `ghcr.io/hotio/lidarr:pr-plugins-2.14.1.4716` |
| Brainarr | 1.2.4 build from `main` |
| .NET | 6.0.4xx SDK for builds, runtime provided by Lidarr |
| Providers | LM Studio 0.2.23 (Local Server), Google Gemini (AI Studio key), Perplexity Pro API |

## Verification Checklist
### Compatibility & Configuration
- [x] Minimum Lidarr version enforced (`plugin.json`, README, docs) – 2.14.1.4716.
- [x] Import list registers correctly and appears in Lidarr ➜ Settings ➜ Import Lists.
- [x] Settings validator rejects missing API keys, invalid URLs, and unsupported models.
- [x] External model registry feature flag defaults to embedded registry.

### Provider Coverage
- [x] LM Studio – auto-detects models via `/v1/models`, supports iterative refinement.
- [x] Gemini – structured JSON (`responseMimeType`) and API key validation confirmed.
- [x] Perplexity – Sonar Large responses parsed and sanitized correctly.
- [ ] Ollama – requires community validation for Brainarr 1.2.4.
- [ ] DeepSeek – requires community validation.
- [ ] Groq – requires community validation.
- [ ] OpenAI – requires community validation.
- [ ] Anthropic – requires community validation.
- [ ] OpenRouter – requires community validation.

### Resilience & Safety
- [x] Recommendation cache prevents duplicate fetches within configured TTL.
- [x] ProviderHealthMonitor gates unhealthy providers and recovers after cooldown.
- [x] Safety gates enforce MBID requirement and minimum confidence thresholds.
- [x] Review queue flag routes borderline items for manual approval.
- [x] Rate limiter defaults (10 req/min, burst 5) respected in tests.

### Documentation Alignment
- [x] README, provider docs, and wiki updated for Brainarr 1.2.4.
- [x] Support matrix reflects verified providers and pending items.
- [x] Troubleshooting steps link to nightly branch requirement and log collection guidance.

## Known Issues / Follow-Up Items
1. Expand automated integration coverage for OpenRouter and DeepSeek (currently manual-only).
2. Document new registry decorator workflow and environment overrides.
3. Publish a short verification how-to (docs + wiki) so contributors can replicate smoke tests.
4. Capture community verification reports in `docs/PROVIDER_SUPPORT_MATRIX.md` as they arrive.
