# Brainarr 1.2.4 - 2025-09-12

## Highlights

- **Model registry foundation**: Added JSON-driven provider/model registry schema plus sample assets to enable zero-rebuild model onboarding.
- **Provider factory decorator**: Introduced registry-aware provider factory behind a feature flag with optional environment API key support for external registries.
- **Registry loader improvements**: Implemented ETag-aware loader with cached/embedded fallback, validation tests, and a dedicated CI workflow to keep registries in sync.
- **Version alignment**: Bumped plugin manifests to 1.2.4 and refreshed docs/wiki content to match the new verified provider status.

## Compatibility

- Lidarr **2.14.1.4716+** on the `nightly` (plugins) branch remains required.
- No database or configuration migrations are needed from 1.2.3.

## Provider Verification Snapshot

Verified through smoke tests in 1.2.4:

- ✅ **LM Studio** – Qwen 3 via Local Server
- ✅ **Google Gemini** – `Gemini_25_Flash` using AI Studio API keys
- ✅ **Perplexity** – `Sonar_Pro` default route

Pending verification in this release:

- Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Groq

## Upgrade Notes

1. Install or update Brainarr via the Lidarr Plugins UI, pointing to `https://github.com/RicherTunes/Brainarr`.
2. Restart Lidarr after deployment so the new manifest and assemblies load.
3. Refresh provider settings if you previously selected renamed models (e.g., switch to the new `Gemini_25_Flash` enum entry).
4. Optional: enable the model registry feature flag to experiment with JSON-based provider catalogs.
