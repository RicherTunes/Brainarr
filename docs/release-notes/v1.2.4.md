# Brainarr 1.2.4 – 2025-09-12

Brainarr 1.2.4 focuses on the new model registry workflow and keeps documentation aligned with Lidarr's nightly/plugin requirements.

## Highlights
- **JSON model registry** – Brainarr now ships with a JSON schema, example assets, and an optional registry loader that makes it possible to publish new provider/model metadata without recompiling the plugin.
- **Registry-aware provider factory** – A decorator wraps the existing `AIProviderFactory` when the `AIProviderFactory.UseExternalModelRegistry` feature flag (or `BRAINARR_MODEL_REGISTRY_URL`) is enabled, letting operators pull model metadata from an HTTP endpoint with ETag validation and local caching.
- **Documentation refresh** – Provider guides, support matrix, and wiki pages updated for Brainarr 1.2.4 with current verification status (LM Studio, Google Gemini, Perplexity) and Lidarr nightly branch requirement.

## Compatibility
- **Lidarr**: Requires Lidarr 2.14.1.4716+ on the `nightly`/plugins branch. Update via Settings ➜ General ➜ Updates ➜ Branch = `nightly`.
- **.NET**: Uses the runtime bundled with Lidarr (no additional install required).

## Provider Verification Summary
- ✅ LM Studio (local) – Qwen 3 via Local Server.
- ✅ Google Gemini (cloud) – Gemini 1.5 Flash with AI Studio key.
- ✅ Perplexity (cloud) – Sonar Large with Pro API key.
- ❓ All other providers (Ollama, DeepSeek, Groq, OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter) compile and expose configuration but need community verification against 1.2.4.

## Upgrade Notes
- No schema changes or migrations are required from 1.2.3.
- If you previously used manual provider model overrides, the registry feature is optional—existing settings continue to work.
- To test the external registry, set `BRAINARR_MODEL_REGISTRY_URL` before launching Lidarr; Brainarr logs whether the decorator is active.
