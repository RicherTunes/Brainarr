# Brainarr 1.2.6 - 2025-09-24

## Highlights

- Removed the bundled FluentValidation assemblies and bound Brainarr to Lidarrâ€™s copy to prevent duplicate loads.
- Locked the build to the host-provided assemblies so `ImportListBase.Test` and other validation paths stay in sync with Lidarr upgrades.

## Compatibility

- Requires Lidarr 2.14.2.4786+ on the nightly (plugins) branch.
- No config changes; safe to install over 1.2.5.

## Testing

- Rebuilt the plugin and reran release, integration, and edge-case suites to confirm the dependency swap.
