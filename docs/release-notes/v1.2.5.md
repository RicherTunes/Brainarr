# Brainarr 1.2.5 - 2025-09-24

## Highlights

- Fixed plugin assembly resolution so Brainarr loads against the Lidarr 2.14.2 nightly assemblies without throwing `ReflectionTypeLoadException`.
- Updated plugin metadata and docs to advertise v1.2.5 compatibility with the current Lidarr nightly baseline.

## Compatibility

- Requires Lidarr 2.14.2.4786+ on the nightly (plugins) branch.
- No database changes; upgrade directly from 1.2.4.

## Testing

- Rebuilt the plugin and reran release, integration, and edge-case suites against the refreshed nightly assemblies.
