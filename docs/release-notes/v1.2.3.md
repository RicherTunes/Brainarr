# Brainarr 1.2.3 - 2025-09-11

This is a CI/docs-only release. No runtime code changes.

Highlights:

- Update Actions: `actions/setup-node@v5`, `actions/setup-python@v6`, `lycheeverse/lychee-action@v2`.
- Stabilize link checks: fixed TOML patterns and limited scope to `README.md` and `docs/`.
- Normalize EOLs and tidy configuration files.
- Docs: Mark Perplexity and LM Studio as tested for 1.2.3; add Perplexity Pro $5/month API credit note.

Compatibility: same as 1.2.2. No migration needed. Plugin manifest updated to `1.2.3`.
