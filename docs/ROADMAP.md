## Development Roadmap

### **Week 1-2: Multi-Provider Foundation**

**Days 1-3**: Provider architecture design

- Implement `IAIProvider` interface and base classes
- Create `AIProviderFactory` and registration system
- Build provider detection system
- Set up configuration framework for multiple providers

**Days 4-7**: Local providers implementation

- Implement Ollama provider with dynamic model detection
- Implement LM Studio provider
- Add Jan.ai and GPT4All providers
- Create provider health monitoring

**Days 8-14**: Cloud providers implementation

- Implement OpenAI provider with all GPT models
- Implement Anthropic provider with Claude models
- Implement Google Gemini provider
- Add Mistral AI, Cohere providers
- Error handling and rate limiting for all cloud providers

### **Week 3: Provider Management & UX**

**Days 15-17**: Provider management system

- Implement failover chain logic
- Create provider capabilities detection
- Build cost estimation system
- Add provider performance monitoring

**Days 18-21**: Enhanced UI and documentation

- Create provider setup wizard
- Implement interactive documentation system
- Add model recommendations per provider
- Create cost calculator for cloud providers

### **Week 4-5: Integration & Advanced Features**

**Days 22-28**: Advanced prompt engineering

- Provider-specific prompt optimization
- Multi-model prompt templates
- Response quality scoring
- A/B testing framework for prompts

**Days 29-35**: Testing and optimization

- Comprehensive testing across all providers
- Performance benchmarking
- Cost optimization strategies
- User acceptance testing

### **Implementation Priority**

**Phase 1 (Essential)**:

1. Ollama provider (local, privacy-focused)
2. OpenAI provider (reliable fallback)
3. Anthropic provider (highest quality)
4. Provider detection and failover

**Phase 2 (Enhanced)**:
5. Google Gemini (cost-effective)
6. LM Studio, Jan.ai (additional local options)
7. Mistral, Cohere (specialized providers)

**Phase 3 (Complete)**:
8. Together AI, Fireworks (open source hosting)
9. Groq (ultra-fast inference)
10. Custom provider framework for future additions

This enhanced architecture gives you the flexibility to support all major AI providers while maintaining a local-first approach. The modular design means you can start with essential providers and add others over time based on user demand.
