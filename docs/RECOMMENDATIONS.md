# Production Readiness Recommendations

Brainarr’s production-readiness story is documented through the release process and verification artifacts rather than a standalone checklist. Use the following sources as the single source of truth:

- [`docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`](RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md) — pre-tag validation and smoke coverage.
- [`docs/VERIFICATION-RESULTS.md`](VERIFICATION-RESULTS.md) — provider verification runs per release.
- [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) — shipped features and breaking changes.
- Wiki [Operations Playbook](https://github.com/RicherTunes/Brainarr/wiki/Operations) pages for day-to-day readiness posture.

If new production requirements emerge, update the checklist or verification docs above so every surface stays aligned. Archived copies of earlier readiness write-ups live under `docs/archive/`.
