# Claude Code Integration Analysis for Brainarr

## Overview
Exploring the feasibility of integrating Claude Code capabilities into the Brainarr music discovery plugin.

## What Claude Code Could Offer

### 1. **Intelligent Music Analysis**
- Analyze your existing music library patterns more deeply
- Understand complex genre relationships and musical evolution
- Generate more nuanced recommendations based on listening history

### 2. **Advanced Query Understanding**
- Natural language queries: "Find me bands that sound like early Pink Floyd but with modern production"
- Complex criteria: "Jazz fusion from the 70s that influenced modern math rock"
- Contextual understanding of music history and influences

### 3. **Music Knowledge Graph**
- Build relationships between artists, genres, and eras
- Understand musical lineages and influences
- Track how genres evolved and merged over time

## Implementation Approaches

### Option 1: Direct API Integration (Simpler)
```csharp
public class ClaudeCodeProvider : BaseAIProvider
{
    private const string CLAUDE_API_URL = "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages";
    
    protected override string ApiUrl => CLAUDE_API_URL;
    public override string ProviderName => "Claude Code";
    
    protected override object BuildRequestBody(string prompt)
    {
        return new
        {
            model = "claude-3-opus-20240229", // or claude-3.5-sonnet
            max_tokens = 4096,
            temperature = 0.7,
            system = @"You are Claude Code integrated into a music discovery system. 
                      Use your deep understanding of music history, genres, and artist relationships 
                      to provide thoughtful recommendations. Consider:
                      - Musical lineages and influences
                      - Production styles and era-specific sounds
                      - Underground and mainstream crossovers
                      - Regional scenes and movements",
            messages = new[]
            {
                new { role = "user", content = prompt }
            }
        };
    }
}
```

### Option 2: MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration (Advanced)
```csharp
public class ClaudeCodeMCPProvider : IAIProvider
{
    private readonly IMCPClient _mcpClient;
    
    public async Task<List<Recommendation>> GetRecommendationsAsync(string prompt)
    {
        // Connect to Claude Code via MCP
        var tools = new[]
        {
            new MCPTool("search_musicbrainz", "Search MusicBrainz database"),
            new MCPTool("analyze_genre", "Analyze genre characteristics"),
            new MCPTool("find_similar", "Find similar artists using embeddings")
        };
        
        var response = await _mcpClient.SendMessageAsync(prompt, tools);
        return ParseMCPResponse(response);
    }
}
```

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
Combine Claude's reasoning with existing providers:

```csharp
public class HybridClaudeProvider : IAIProvider
{
    private readonly ClaudeCodeProvider _claude;
    private readonly IMusicBrainzResolver _musicBrainz;
    private readonly ILibraryAnalyzer _analyzer;
    
    public async Task<List<Recommendation>> GetRecommendationsAsync(string prompt)
    {
        // Step 1: Analyze library with Claude's understanding
        var analysis = await _claude.AnalyzeLibraryPatterns(_analyzer.GetProfile());
        
        // Step 2: Generate creative recommendations
        var recommendations = await _claude.GetRecommendationsAsync(
            $"{prompt}\n\nLibrary Analysis: {analysis}");
        
        // Step 3: Validate with MusicBrainz
        var validated = new List<Recommendation>();
        foreach (var rec in recommendations)
        {
            var resolved = await _musicBrainz.ResolveRecommendation(rec);
            if (resolved.Status == ResolutionStatus.Resolved)
                validated.Add(rec);
        }
        
        return validated;
    }
}
```

## Code Example: Quick Implementation

```csharp
public class ClaudeProvider : BaseAIProvider
{
    public ClaudeProvider(IHttpClient httpClient, Logger logger, string apiKey, string model)
        : base(httpClient, logger, apiKey, model ?? "claude-3-5-sonnet-latest")
    {
    }

    public override string ProviderName => "Claude";
    protected override string ApiUrl => "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages";

    protected override object BuildRequestBody(string prompt)
    {
        return new
        {
            model = _model,
            max_tokens = 4096,
            temperature = 0.7,
            system = @"You are a music discovery expert with deep knowledge of:
                      - Music history from classical to contemporary
                      - Underground and mainstream scenes
                      - Genre evolution and fusion
                      - Regional music movements
                      - Artist influences and lineages
                      
                      Provide thoughtful recommendations that consider musical DNA,
                      production styles, and cultural context. Be specific about
                      WHY each recommendation fits.",
            messages = new[]
            {
                new { role = "user", content = prompt }
            }
        };
    }

    protected override string ExtractContentFromResponse(string responseContent)
    {
        var data = JObject.Parse(responseContent);
        return data["content"]?[0]?["text"]?.ToString();
    }
}
```

## Benefits of Claude Code Integration

1. **Superior Understanding**: Claude understands nuanced musical relationships
2. **Creative Recommendations**: Goes beyond simple genre matching
3. **Contextual Awareness**: Understands cultural and historical context
4. **Natural Language**: Users can describe what they want naturally
5. **Explanation Power**: Can explain why recommendations fit

## Conclusion

**Feasibility: HIGH** ✅

Claude Code integration is definitely feasible and would add significant value:

1. **Quick Win**: Basic integration can be done in 2-3 hours
2. **Uses Existing Patterns**: Fits into current provider architecture
3. **Immediate Value**: Better recommendations from day one
4. **Growth Potential**: Can evolve into more sophisticated features

The implementation is NOT too complex - it follows the same pattern as other providers but with Claude's superior understanding of music relationships and history.
