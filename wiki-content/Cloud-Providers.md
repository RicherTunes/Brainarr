# Cloud providers

All cloud provider guidance now lives in the repo so it stays versioned with the code.

- Start with [docs/configuration.md](../docs/configuration.md) for enabling cloud providers and supplying API keys.
- Check [docs/PROVIDER_MATRIX.md](../docs/PROVIDER_MATRIX.md) for verification status and notes.
- Use [docs/tokenization-and-estimates.md](../docs/tokenization-and-estimates.md) and [docs/troubleshooting.md](../docs/troubleshooting.md) to handle tokenizer drift and JSON errors.

Update those docs when behaviour changes, then leave a short pointer here.
