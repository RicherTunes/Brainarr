> First time with Brainarr? Follow this linear checklist—each step links to the deeper guides when you need them.

1. **Install Brainarr**
   - Set Lidarr to the `nightly` branch and install Brainarr via the Lidarr plugin UI (see [Installation](Installation)).
2. **Choose a provider**
   - Read the [Provider Selector](Provider-Selector) for a fast decision, then dive into [Local Providers](Local-Providers) or [Cloud Providers](Cloud-Providers) for setup details.
3. **Run the quick start**
   - Follow the README quick start and the [First Run Guide](First-Run-Guide) to validate connectivity and quality.
4. **Tune advanced settings**
   - Review the [Advanced Settings](Advanced-Settings) table to understand sampling, safety gates, and token budgets. Adjust only after the defaults work.
5. **Schedule operations**
   - Use the [Operations Playbook](Operations) for Day‑N routines, review queue triage, and incident response.
6. **Stay in sync**
   - When updating docs or provider data, follow the [Documentation Workflow](Documentation-Workflow) and run `pwsh ./build.ps1 -Docs` locally.
