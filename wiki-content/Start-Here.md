# Start here

Use the repository docs for the authoritative onboarding flow.

1. Complete the [Quickstart](../README.md#quickstart) to install the plugin and run your first discovery.
2. Read [docs/configuration.md](../docs/configuration.md) for defaults and optional cloud settings.
3. Keep [docs/upgrade-notes-1.3.0.md](../docs/upgrade-notes-1.3.0.md) handy for team rollouts.

Keep this page as a checklist pointing to those canonical docs.
