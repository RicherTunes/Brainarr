# Installation

Installation instructions now live in the repository README so we only maintain one source of truth.

Requires Lidarr 2.14.2.4786+ on the plugins/nightly branch.

- Follow the [Quickstart](../README.md#quickstart) steps for installing Brainarr and validating the default local provider.
- Review [docs/configuration.md](../docs/configuration.md) if you need to tune planner cache or switch providers.

Update the docs first if anything changes, then keep this page as a pointer.
