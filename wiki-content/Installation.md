2. Go to Settings > Plugins.
3. Click Add Plugin.
4. Paste the repository URL: <https://github.com/RicherTunes/Brainarr>
5. Click Install, then Restart when prompted.
6. Go to Settings > Import Lists and add Brainarr.

## Manual install from Releases (alternative)

If you prefer manual installation, follow the steps in the repository README:

- [Installing from Releases](../README.md#installing-from-releases)
- Then continue with the [Quickstart](../README.md#quickstart) to validate the default local provider.

For configuration details (timeouts, providers, planner/cache), see [docs/configuration.md](../docs/configuration.md).
