# Script to apply the workflow fix for Brainarr CI

echo "This script will show you the exact changes needed to fix the CI workflow"
echo "Since workflow files require manual updates, you'll need to apply these changes yourself"
echo ""
echo "=== STEP 1: Update .github/workflows/ci.yml ==="
echo ""
echo "Replace the entire contents of .github/workflows/ci.yml with:"
echo "----------------------------------------"
cat .github-workflows-fixed/ci.yml
echo "----------------------------------------"
echo ""
echo "=== STEP 2: Commit and Push ==="
echo ""
echo "After updating the workflow file, commit it directly to the main branch:"
echo "  git add .github/workflows/ci.yml"
echo "  git commit -m 'fix: Add submodules:true to CI workflow for Lidarr dependency'"
echo "  git push origin main"
echo ""
echo "=== Why This Fix Works ==="
echo "1. The CI needs to fetch the Lidarr submodule we added"
echo "2. Adding 'submodules: true' to checkout steps fetches the submodule"
echo "3. This provides the real Lidarr projects the build needs"
echo ""
echo "The CI will automatically re-run after this change and should pass!"
